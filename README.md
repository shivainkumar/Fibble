A social media platform for sharing recipes. Built with React-native, Google Firebase and Redux.

How often do you find yourself looking for new recipes online? I constantly find myself looking for new recipes online or exchanging recipes with friends and family. I, as a foodie who is also a vegetarian, spend a lot of time looking for recipes online, scouring the internet. There are some websites that I go to looking for new recipes that are good. The problem with the existing sites on the internet is that they are controlled catalogs of recipes, that is, people submit their recipes, the owner of the site approves the recipes, and then they are posted on the site. Essentially, they are like blogs or e-magazines. I felt like there was a need for a social media platform for sharing recipes.
